## ** Binary Heaps**  
### **Key Concepts:**  
- **Min-Heap:** Parent ≤ Children  
- **Max-Heap:** Parent ≥ Children  
- **Insert/Extract-Min:** O(log n)  

### **Python Implementation (Using `heapq`)**  
```python
import heapq
min_heap = []
heapq.heappush(min_heap, 3)  # Insert (O(log n))
heapq.heappush(min_heap, 1)
min_val = heapq.heappop(min_heap)  # Extract-Min (O(log n))
```
